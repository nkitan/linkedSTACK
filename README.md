Written by: ANKIT @nkitan

DISCLAIMER: This is a project i made up for fun, i know it has bugs.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a rather crude and simple implementation of a Stack data structure in c++ lanugage.
It has some bugs but they're being worked upon. your suggestions would be really helpful. 
I need your help to fix it! 

TESTED ON DEV C++ running TDM GCC 4.9.2 using MinGW.

#Windows
COMPILE AND RUN USING YOUR FAVOURITE IDE.
I recommend DEV C++ or Code::Blocks

#Linux
USE COMMAND 
$ gcc linkedSTACK.cpp -o linkedSTACK

make sure you have GCC installed by installing Build-Essentials.
