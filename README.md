------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a rather crude and simple implementation of a Stack data structure in C++ lanugage.
It has some bugs but they're being worked upon. your suggestions would be really helpful. 
I need your help to fix it! 

-WINDOWS-
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Compile and run using your favourite compiler/IDE.
I recommend DEV C++ or Code::Blocks.

-LINUX-
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
 In the directory of the cpp file, use command 
 > $ gcc linkedSTACK.cpp -o linkedSTACK 


 NOTE: Make sure you have GCC installed on your Environment.


FEATURES
---------
* Pushing , poping and display using functions ( Modular )
* Menu driven
* Dynamically allocated memory
* ( Virutally ) Infinite storage , no limits to amount of data
* Data structure can be changed very easily
* Deletion of buffer / memory using destructor
* Quick runtime
* Auto Deletion of allocated Memory upon exit
