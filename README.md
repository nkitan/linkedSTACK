# linkedSTACK

a linked list implementation of a STACK written in C++

This is a rather crude and simple implementation of a Stack data structure in C++ lanugage.
It has some bugs but they're being worked upon. your suggestions would be really helpful. 
I need your help to fix it! 

FOR LINUX
---------
run the included linkedSTACK ELF Binary using ./linkedSTACK 
(you might have to set its permissions to executable using chmod +x linkedSTACK)

OR

compile the included cpp file using g++ linkedSTACK.cpp -o linkedSTACK
then, run the binary file using ./linkedSTACK


FOR WINDOWS
-----------
run the included linkedSTACK.exe executable

OR

Compile and run using your favourite compiler/IDE.
recommended: DEV C++ or Code::Blocks

FEATURES
---------
* Pushing , poping and display using functions ( Modular )
* Menu driven (CLI)
* Dynamically allocated memory
* ( Virutally ) Infinite storage , no limits to amount of data
* Data structure can be changed very easily
* Deletion of buffer / memory using destructor
* Quick runtime
* Auto Deletion of allocated Memory upon exit
