Written by: ANKIT @nkitan

DISCLAIMER: This is a project i made up for fun, i know it has bugs.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a rather crude and simple implementation of a Stack data structure in c++ lanugage.
It has some bugs but they're being worked upon. your suggestions would be really helpful. 
I need your help to fix it! 

TESTED ON DEV C++ running TDM GCC 4.9.2 using MinGW.

-WINDOWS-
 compile and run using your favourite compiler/IDE.
 I recommend DEV C++ or Code::Blocks.

-LINUX-
 use command 
 > $ gcc linkedSTACK.cpp -o linkedSTACK <
 in the directory of the cpp file.

 NOTE:make sure you have GCC installed by installing Build-Essentials.
